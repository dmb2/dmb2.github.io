I've been working on the <a href="http://cryptopals.com">Matasano Crypto Challenges</a>. They are worth an
article on their own<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>.  In them you learn crypto as deployed in web
applications. They teach you crypto systems by breaking them.  This is
an excellent way to learn crypto.  It teaches you to assess systems
based on potential weaknesses rather than their abstract properties.
</p>

<p>
A crypto implementation is usually built out of smaller units called
crypto primitives.  It is important that these smaller units be secure
against leaking information.  If not the integrity of the entire
system is compromised.  An important cryptographic primative is the
pseudo-random number generator (PRNG). While cryptographically secure
PRNGs (CSPRNGs) exist<sup><a id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>, programmers may not realize that they
should use them.  Instead they reach for their language's native PRNG.
</p>

<p>
This this is in all likelihood the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister">Mersenne Twister PRNG</a>, based on a
Mersenne prime number.  I still haven't grokked why this is important
to the algorithm. I do know that it makes the period of the PRNG (the
amount of time before the PRNG repeats an output) huge (~10<sup>6000</sup>).
The algorithm is explained in technical detail on the wikipedia page
linked above.  What interests me the most is the final step of the
algorithm.  This is the "tempering step" when the state array output
is transformed. Reversing the tempering step is <a href="https://jazzy.id.au/2010/09/22/cracking_random_number_generators_part_3.html">covered in</a> many places
as <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16365125/what-makes-the-mersenne-twister-tempering-function-reversible">well</a>. The mathematical description of the algorithm calls for the
tempering matrix to be invertible, meaning: 
$$
x_{i} = T s_{i}
$$ 
$$
s_{i} = T^{-1}x_{i}
$$
Where \(T\) is the tempering matrix and \(T^{-1}\) must exist.  On paper,
it is possible to take an output from the Mersenne RNG and multiply
the bit-vector by \(T^{-1}\). This recovers one of the internal states
\(s_{i}\).  Repeat this 624 times and you have discovered the entire
internal state of the RNG. You can now predict every future output of
the RNG for all time.  If your crypto system is based on the Mersenne
RNG once you've cloned it you can create the same stream of bytes.
This may allow you to decrypt all future encrypted messages (and with
a little more work, all past messages).
</p>

<p>
I say on paper, because it turns out that inverting \(T\) as it is
stated isn't as clear as inverting a matrix.  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister#Algorithmic_detail">algorithm specifies</a>
\(T\) as:
$$
x := s\oplus ((s >> u) \otimes d)\\
x := x\oplus ((x << s) \otimes b)\\
x := x\oplus ((x << t) \otimes c)\\
x := x\oplus ((x >> t))\\
$$
Where \(s\) is an input from the internal state, \(x\) is the final
result, \(\oplus\) is addition mod 2 (bitwise xor), &gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt; are the
right and left bitshift operators respectively, \(\otimes\) is
multiplication mod 2 (bitwise and). Finally \(u\), \(d\), \(s\), \(b\), \(t\),
and \(c\) are parameters for the tempering transform.  The specific
values can be referenced on the wiki page or <a href="http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/MT2002/CODES/mt19937ar.c">in the reference
implementation provided by</a> the author of the algorithm.
</p>

<p>
As attackers we're after the internal state of the RNG.  This means
inverting the tempering transformation outlined above.  How can we do
this? If we wanted we could construct a matrix representation of \(T\)
and invert this matrix. This seems infeasible on the face of it. Let's
instead look at some interesting properties of each transformation
step. I don't know if this combination of operations has a name in the
literature. I've taken to calling them diffuse operations.<sup><a id="fnr.3" name="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup> If
you are trying to wrap your head around these transformations, I
recommend playing with them on paper.
</p>

<p>
Let's look at one in detail:
$$ 
x := x\oplus ((x >> a) \otimes b) 
$$
<a href="https://jazzy.id.au/2010/09/22/cracking_random_number_generators_part_3.html#comment-1547785947">A source of confusion</a> is the bitwise and since we think of this
operation as "throwing away" information.  It seems that we're loosing
information when a <code>0</code> in \(b\)'s bit vector is propagated through
multiplication by (x &gt;&gt; a).  For the moment lets ignore this and set
the \(b\) vector to all <code>1</code>'s (<code>0xFFFFFFFF</code> for a 32 bit Mersenne
RNG). Let's also work with 8 bit numbers. You can write them on a
sheet of paper without cramping your hand or making too many mistakes.
</p>

<p>
In the following, \(|x|\) is the number of bits represented by \(x\) (32
in the full case, 8 in our toy). First note that if \(a > |x|/2\) we
have the following interesting property. Say \(a=5\), if we put each
operation on its own row<sup><a id="fnr.4" name="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup> we have:
</p>
<pre class="example">
       x: 1  0  1  1  1  0  1  1 
    x&gt;&gt;a: 0  0  0  0  0  1  0  1 
x^(x&gt;&gt;a): 1  0  1  1  1  1  1  0
</pre>
<p>
Notice that the first \(a=5\) bits of the output is the same as the
input.  This is remarkable. It provides an immediate answer for how we
recover the original \(x\), inverting the transformation:
</p>
<pre class="example">
       x: 1  0  1  1  1  1  1  0 
    x&gt;&gt;a: 0  0  0  0  0  1  0  1 
x^(x&gt;&gt;a): 1  0  1  1  1  0  1  1
</pre>
<p>
When we shift over 5 places, we put the same three bits in the lower
part that we xor, this recovers the input.  Those zeros also mean that
if you multiply by a mask the same pattern will hold:
</p>
<pre class="example">
           x: 1  0  1  1  1  0  1  1 
    (x&gt;&gt;a)&amp;b: 0  0  0  0  0  1  0  0 
x^((x&gt;&gt;a)&amp;b): 1  0  1  1  1  1  1  1
</pre>
<p>
We now know that the first \(a\) bits are untouched by this
transformation.  This is the key to reversing it.  The left shift case
is symmetric.  
</p>

<p>
Let us now turn to the more complicated case when \(a < |x|/2\). In this
case, when we go to recover the bits, some of the scrambled bits will
be "in the way" and we may not get a clean recovery the way we do when
\(a > |x|/2\).  How do we proceed? We still have \(a\) bits at the front
that are untouched, so we can get \(2a\) bytes with one diffuse step.
If we continue to feed the output of the diffuse step as the input to
the next, eventually we'll recover the original integer.  
</p>

<p>
The only trouble with this is that it is not clear how to calculate
the number of times you need to apply the diffuse step in order to
recover the (unknown) integer.  Furthermore, the number of steps
required depends on \(x\).  While it seems we're at an impasse, it is
possible to write down a modified diffuse procedure that takes the
original \(x\) value.  Then, it is simply a matter of applying the
modified procedure \(\lceil |x|/a \rceil\) times.  The modified
procedure is:
$$ 
r := x
r := x \oplus ((r >> a) \otimes b) 
$$
</p>

<p>
There you have it, a prescription for undoing each step of the
tempering function.  When implemented, you apply the inverse of each
diffusion step in reverse order. This inverts the tempering of RNG
output.  From here its a short step to getting the internal state of
the RNG and thus break the whole thing wide open.
</p>

<p>
There are some unanswered questions though. The diffuse steps are
cyclic, meaning that if you let:
$$
d(x,c,b) = x \oplus (x >> c) \otimes b
$$
and you repeatedly feed the output of one to the input of the next:
$$
d^{(n)}(x,c,b)=d(d^{(n-1)}(x,c,b),c,b)\\
d^{0}(x,c,b)=d(x,c,b)
$$
then there exists a finite \(n\) such that
$$
x = d^{(n)}(x,c,b)
$$
</p>

<p>
In this case, reversing the tempering is just a matter of figuring out
how to derive \(n\) for values of \(x\), \(c\) and \(b\). I suspect that the answer
is independent of \(b\), but I haven't been able to get anywhere on
actually constructing an argument that proves any real
relationship. Furthermore, my small explorations show that while \(n\)
is finite, it depends on \(x\), this is undesirable since it requires
knowledge that is initially inaccessible.  
</p>

<p>
One final point before I close: This entire attack hinges on the
tempering step being invertible.  If the tempering step weren't
invertible, the attack wouldn't work and the internal state would
remain hidden from attackers, securing this PRNG. The most obvious way
of achieving this is to hash the output and then use whatever bits of
the hash are required for the application.  The issue with this is
that hashes may skew the statistical properties of the PRNG, or worse,
provide side-channel leaks.
</p>

<p>
In closing, crypto is a lot of fun. The math involved while simple,
has subtleties that are fun to play around with. I hope that if
you are also wandering the path towards crypto enlightenment that you
find this explanation useful.  If you have any comments, you can tweet
