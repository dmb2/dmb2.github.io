<h2 id="sec-1">TLDR;</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Common Lisp applications that use the X11 protocol are missing
important X11 extensions that would allow them to support
internationalized input. Specifically, the xkeyboard protocol must be
fully implemented to rectify these problems for any application
utlizing CLX.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Introduction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
In 1987, the X11 standard was formalized. It is the de-facto standard
for graphics primitives on the *nix desktop. X11 is a client-server
protocol that abstracts away direct calls to hardware rendering. It
allows <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System">graphical desktops</a> to be rendered in mainframe environments
where the server is physically separated from the client. If you've
ever forwarded X11 over ssh, you've interacted with a remote X11
server. Most of the time the X11 server is resident on the local
machine, and the client-server connection is over a Unix socket.
</p>

<p>
It is important to understand that almost all user facing applications
are clients to the server (all the way down to your window manager).
This means that if you write an X11 client with a library that doesn't
support the modern features of your server, that application will not
take full advantage of the server. Other applications written with
different X11 client libraries which support modern features will have
no trouble responding to the new extensions in the appropriate manner.
</p>

<p>
It may sound like I'm harping on a subtle distinction that would never
come up in the real world. However it has in the case of
internationalization and localization support in the Common Lisp X
interface (CLX). Further, there seems to be no resources out there for
eager contributors to read and understand the problem from end to end.
This article aims to rectify that.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">CLX, Xlib and XCB</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
For many years the standard library implementing X11 client protocols
in C was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xlib">Xlib</a>. In fact it is still widely used by higher level
tool-kits that provide further GUI abstractions. Xlib has its own set
of problems and cruft associated with its long shelf-life. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XCB">2001 XCB
(X C Bindings)</a> was developed to address these problems. XCB is unique
in that it defines the X protocol (and its extensions) in XML format
and then generates the C bindings dynamically. If you write an X11
client application in C, in 2018, you should be using XCB.
</p>

<p>
Most non-C languages interface with Xlib through some sort of foreign
function interface. This has the advantage that features added to Xlib
are carried over to languages which interface from it. The situation
for Common Lisp is different. The Common Lisp X interface (CLX) does
not interface with Xlib, instead it implements the protocol directly.
I'm speculating, but I expect that this exists because of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_machine">Lisp
Machines</a> of the 70s and 80s. They were entirely different animals from
Unix, and had Lisp baked into their hardware. In that environment, X11
would have been a protocol to allow a lisp machine to accept clients
from Unix mainframes. It makes sense then that the library would be
written in Common Lisp from the ground up.
</p>

<p>
What would happen next is still causing echos today in modern lisp
applications. In the time period of 1987-1993 the Lisp Machine market
collapsed in the wake of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter">AI winter</a>. The CLX manual, dated 1988,
came at the end of the Lisp Machine's relevance in computing research.
In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Linux">1991 Linus Torvalds released</a> the first version of Linux, and
ushered in an era of unix-like desktops. The ubiquity of a free
version of unix-like operating system and the explosion of the
internet created market pressures which lead to internationalization
support in Xlib that didn't exist in the Common Lisp ecosystem.
Extensions such as xkeyboard (XKB) have never been fully implemented,
and it is difficult as a sole developer to fully implement a protocol
standard as complicated as XKB. This is further complicated by the
fact that end users typically want to be able to type non-english
letters and it is not clear how to communicate this in a way that
points developers to the XKB extension.

<div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">The state of the art</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
There has been significant progress. SBCL supports unicode characters,
and <a href="https://filonenko-mikhail.github.io/clx-truetype/">rendering</a> toolkits can <a href="https://github.com/dbjergaard/clx-ft2-renderer">render</a> the glyphs appropriately. The
missing secret sauce is a implementation of XKB. A few people have
ventured deep enough into this problem to identify the missing piece,
but a full solution has not made it into <a href="https://github.com/sharplispers/clx">sharplispers/clx</a>, the
community's source for CLX.
</p>

<p>
McClim (a major graphics toolkit) has placed a significant bounty on
this <a href="https://github.com/McCLIM/McCLIM/issues/35">very issue</a>. The success condition for that bounty has been that
"input [is obeyed by a] keyboard layout set with <code>setxkbmap</code>
asynchronusly at runtime by the user from another process (i.e
terminal)." Another more <a href="https://github.com/filonenko-mikhail/clx-xkeyboard">promising effort</a> is available as a standalone
extension in quicklisp. I have just discovered this code, and I have
no idea how close it is to solving the issue.

<h2 id="sec-5">Contributing</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
If you've made it this far, you're probably eagerly consuming any
information on this topic and want to contribute. My nominal plan is
to host a fork of <a href="https://github.com/sharplispers/clx">sharplispers/clx</a>.  I will contact Mikhail Filonenko
about taking over his copy of xkeyboard and I will add stubs of
function definitions for xkeyboard.  Contributing will be a matter of
opening a PR with an implementation of a missing function.  Once we
have the majority of the protocol implemented we can contribute it
back to sharplispers/clx and the whole Lisp community will profit.
</p>

<p>
Even if you are not affected by internationalized input, having XKB
available will be useful as it makes it possible to do things that are
impossible with the core implementation of keyboards. Specifically, it
becomes possible to have multiple keys trigger the same key event
which makes it possible to have multiple prefix keys in StumpWM. It
also makes it possible to support weird keyboard layouts that have
different modifiers than what a generic keyboard can handle.

<h2 id="sec-6">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
Hopefully this will serve as a roadmap of how and why Common Lisp has
poor support for international input and will help dispel some of the
confusion around the topic. If you are new to Common Lisp and affected
by this issue, take a look at my fork of CLX. There may be something
you can contribute to which will help us solve the problem once and
for all. If you have any comments, you can tweet me <a href="https://twitter.com/dbjergaard">@dbjergaard</a>.
