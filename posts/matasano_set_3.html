<h2 id="sec-1">Set 3</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
This set wraps up the CBC portion of our attacks and covers the
importance of cryptographically strong pseudo-random number (CSPRNG)
generators.  There's a lot of meat in this one, but nothing terribly
new until we get to Challenge 21.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-1">Challenge 17</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
This is a great attack, and it relies on something we setup and tested
in set 2, namely that the CBC block we're decrypting has valid
padding.  This is our first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciphertext-only_attack">ciphertext only attack</a>, its also our first
exposure to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack">side-channel leak</a>.  Its important to realize that a
side-channel attack exploits information that depends on the
encryption procedure, but it does not attack the encryption procedure
directly.  Side-channel attacks can be prevented by securing the
information leaked, in this case, the fact that the padding is invalid
should not be exposed to our adversaries.
</p>

<p>
The attack procedure itself is outlined very well on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padding_oracle_attack">wikipedia
page</a>, so I won't go over too much of the specifics (annoying I know,
but the article really does cover it at the right level). We've used
an oracle before in Challenge 11, but this is the first time its front
and center.  Oracle's in cryptanalysis are appropriately named because
they tell us something about the ciphertext without giving us the
plaintext back.  In this specific case, the oracle is telling us if
the submitted ciphertext has valid padding of the plaintext.  Through
successive edits to the ciphertext (in order to create valid padding)
we are able to extract the plaintext bytes.
</p>

<p>
In real world applications, the oracle is typically a remote server
where we can submit cipher texts and observe the server's response.
The server has a vested interest in not exposing the plaintext, but it
may leak information about the decryption that we as attackers can
exploit.
</p>

<h3 id="sec-1-2">Challenge 18</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
AES-CTR is our first stream cipher.  The idea is to use the output of
AES-ECB when encrypting the result of a running counter and a key.
This generates a stream of random looking bits that we can use to XOR
against an input string.  As soon as we see the XOR part of the
operation, alarm bells should ring that bit-flipping attacks are
available.  What we're doing here is using AES-ECB as a CSPRNG.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-3">Challenge 19-20</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
The next two challenges are related. The first sets up our intuition
about guessing the keystream when its re-used, and the second
(Challenge 20) is a throwback to the repeating-key XOR from Set 1.
(You remember that right?) all the same techniques still apply, so
dust of your code from Set 1 and knock these two out quickly.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-1-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-4">Challenge 21</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">
<p>
I became obsessed with Challenge 21-23 for a time.  I <a href="./untempering_mersenne_twister.html">wrote about it
previously</a>, so I won't repeat myself. Challenge 21 is simply
implementing the algorithm, it goes pretty quick.  You'll want to at
least implement it yourself following pseudocode or translating from a
different language to get a feel for how its going.  
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-1-5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-5">Challenge 22</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-5">
<p>
The key idea here is to set the MTRNG up with an unknown timestamp,
and then discover it by trying successive seeds in another MTRNG until
you get the same output as the MTRNG with the unknown seed.  The
problem suggests that you wait (as you would have to do if the MTRNG
was on a remote server) and then try to clone the output, but I was
lazy.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-1-6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-6">Challenge 24</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-6">
<p>
If we do Challenge 24 given the parameters of the challenge, then the
MTRNG is easily crackable (the key space (2<sup>16</sup>) is really small) and
the follow-up exercise (password reset token) is seeded by the current
timestamp. This doesn't do justice to the MTRNG as a CSPRNG.
Challenges 20-23 systematically broke the MTRNG as a cryptographic
construct, but they rely on the attacker recovering the entire 32 bit (or
64 bit) output of the algorithm.  
</p>

<p>
If the attacker only has access to the first 8 bits of the output, it
is impossible to recover the internal state.  Then the security lies
only in the key.  In this problem, the keyspace is too small.  Even if
we expanded our keyspace to be 32 or 64 bit single-integer seeds, then
our attack would still take as long as it took our implementation to
try each possible integer seed.
</p>

<p>
Instead, it is possible to seed the MTRNG's internal state with 628
32bit integers with a suitable amount of entropy, and use the
resulting output as a secure key-stream.  Now the key space has grown
considerably (2<sup>(628*32)</sup> to be exact), and it is no longer feasible to
try to clone the stream even on modern hardware.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
That wraps up Set 3.  We've finished our coverage of block crypto and
gotten our feet wet with stream crypto.  We anticipate CTR bitflipping
attacks.  Additionally we've covered a lot of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_model">main attack models</a>
in cryptanalysis. At this point we've got a lot of the infrastructure
code set up so that doing the challenges in Set 4 can re-use our
existing idioms.  If not, now is a good time to refactor and write
tests so that you can verify that your changes aren't breaking things.
Looking forward to Set 4, we'll need a lot of code to simulate servers
in various settings that all do similar things, so having a server
baseclass is useful.
