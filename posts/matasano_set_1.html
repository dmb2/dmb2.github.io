<p>
Matasano security (now part of <a href="https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/our-services/security-consulting/">NCC Group</a>) has circulated a set of six
challenges related to implementing cryptographic protocols.  They
start basic and become more sophisticated, but they all revolve around
exposing flaws in naive implementations. Originally they were
circulated by email and you had to submit your solutions before
advancing to the next set.  In addition, Matasano required that
write-ups not be published in order to avoid people just reading
solutions and not fully grokking the implementation flaw being
exposed. 
</p>

<p>
Now, anything is allowed. All seven sets (the original six plus a
bonus set) are published at <a href="http://cryptopals.com/">cryptopals.com</a>.  I want to write up my
impressions, and hints, but I don't want to give away the
solutions. That being said, my solutions are here:
<a href="https://github.com/dbjergaard/cryptopals-solutions">github.com/cryptopals-solutions</a>.  Please don't read them until you've
either solved it yourself, or exhausted all help on #cryptopals on
freenode.

<h3 id="sec-2-1">Challenge 1 and 2</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
The first two challenges are warm up.  The first, converting between
hex and base64, are designed to get you comfortable thinking in
bytes.  Base64 is used a lot to encode binary information, in the
challenges and on the web.  Hex is used to view the "raw bytes."  The
only thing that bears a little elaboration is the Cryptopals Rule:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Always operate on raw bytes, never on encoded strings. Only use hex and base64 for pretty-printing.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
What this means is, don't write your code to depend on the string
representation of the hex values. Put another way: always operate on
unsigned integers ranging from 0 to 255.  
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-2-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-2">Challenge 3</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
Challenge 3 is the first time we have to discover a secret given a
cipher text.  The single byte XOR, is another name for the Ceasar
cipher.  Since the key is a single byte, there are only 255
possible key values. This makes it very simple to test all possible
keys.  The only challenge comes in detecting which key produces the
correct plain text.  
</p>

<p>
There are a number of ways to approach this problem.  One is to
require that all characters of the decrypted text be printable.
Another (and the one hinted in the challenge, and required later on)
is to use frequency analysis.  Since the XOR operation translates each
byte of the plaintext string by the same amount, it doesn't modify the
frequency distribution of the input text.  This means that the correct
key is the one that produces the frequency distribution that most
closely matches the plaintext distribution.  In this case, its
english.  What metric should we use to determine how close they are?
Again, there are many possible, but the one I've used is a combination
of requiring printable ASCII characters and Pearson's \(\chi^2\) test.
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson%2527s_chi-squared_test">wikipedia article</a> describes the nitty gritty details, but the part
you need to implement is:
</p>
\begin{equation}
\chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{(O_i-E_i)^2}{E_i}
\end{equation}

<p>
If we view this as a histogram, \(O_i\) is the \(i^{\text{th}}\) bin of
the histogram we observe with a given key (ie, the frequency histogram
when we decrypt the ciphertext with key \(k\)).  Similarly, \(E_i\) is the
\(i^{\text{th}}\) bin of the expected English frequency histogram.
These histograms should be normalized so that the sum of their bin
values is 1.  If you don't think in terms of histograms and bins, then
look at it as \(O_i\) is the probability that you observe the
\(i^{\text{th}}\) letter of your alphabet.  In this challenge, and
challenge 6, the alphabet used is important.  One that works is \(A\) =
{ <code>a-z</code>, ' '}. It doesn't matter what alphabet you choose as long as
you are consistent in your definitions for \(O_i\) and \(E_i\).
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-3">Challenge 6</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
Challenge 4 exercises the code and concepts you developed in
challenge 3.  Challenge 5 sets up the code you need for
challenge 6. Challenge 6 is the challenge that tests your ability to
make multiple pieces of code work together to produce a result greater
than the sum of its pieces.  The challenge text does a good job of
outlining the strategy and if you have consistent definitions in place
from the previous challenges, then you should be good to go.
</p>

<p>
There are two parts of this challenge that can use a little
elaboration.  The first is determining the key length, the second is
using the key length to extract the key.  
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-2-3-1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-2-3-1">Determining the key of a Vigenere cipher given its length</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-3-1">
<p>
Lets take a concrete example
from the Vigenere cipher.  Let our plain text be:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Speak softly and carry a big stick; you will go far.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Which after removing spaces and punctuation and up-casing is:
</p>
<pre class="example">
SPEAKSOFTLYANDCARRYABIGSTICKYOUWILLGOFAR
</pre>
<p>
Let our key be \(k\) = "<code>SECRET</code>", then our cipher text is:
</p>
<pre class="example">
KTGROLGJVCCTFHERVKQEDZKLLMEBCHMAKCPZGJCI
</pre>
<p>
Now we put ourselves in the shoes of the cryptanalyst.  Lets say he
knows the length of the key, but not the word.  If we break up the
cipher text in columns with rows the same length of the key (6 in this
example) we get:
</p>
<pre class="example">
SECRET
------
KTGROL
GJVCCT
FHERVK
QEDZKL
LMEBCH
MAKCPZ
GJCI
</pre>
<p>
Now notice that All the letters that line up in the first column
correspond to a Caesar cipher with key "S":
</p>
<pre class="example">
K G F Q L M G
</pre>
<p>
Everything in the second column is a Caesar cipher with key "E":
</p>
<pre class="example">
T J H E M A J
</pre>
<p>
And so on.  Once we solve the Caesar cipher for each column (choosing
the key that gives a frequency distribution that looks most like
English), we have the set of Caesar keys that give the total Vigenere
key \(k\) = "<code>SECRET</code>". 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-3-2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-2-3-2">Determining the key length</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-3-2">
<p>
Now that we know how to figure out the key given its length, we have
to figure out its length.  As usual, there are a number of different
approaches, but the one suggested by the challenge works well.  
</p>

<p>
It requires that we calculate the Hamming distance between two
strings. The first reason this works so well, is that in a binary
alphabet we have just two letters (<code>0</code> and <code>1</code>). The Hamming distance
measures the numbers of substitutions to transform one sequence to
another.  If you play with a few binary sequences you will find that
the bits which must change in string \(A\) and string \(B\) is: \(C = A
\oplus B\). To compute the Hamming distance we just sum the number of
<code>1</code>'s in the resulting binary string \(C\).
</p>

<p>
The second reason that this works is the property that if \(A \equiv
B\), then \(A \oplus B = 0\).  Now if we look at the repeating key XOR cipher
again, we have (using binary XOR instead of adding mod 26):
</p>
<pre class="example">
    53454352455453454352455453454352455453454352455453454352455453454352455453454352

    ----------------------------------------
    001506130e071c03171e1c151d01001317060a04011b0207070c00191c1b06120a1e09131c030200
</pre>
<p>
If we guess the key length to be three (\(L=3\)), then we would find the
hamming distance between:
</p>
\begin{equation}
H('\text{001506}','\text{130e07}')=8
\end{equation}
<p>
Symbolically we would have (\(C[x:y]\) denotes the substring starting at \(x\)
and ending at \(y\)):
</p>
\begin{align}
H(C[0:3] &,C[3:6]) =8 \\
H(P[0:3]\oplus K[0:3] &,P[3:6] \oplus K[3:6]) =8
\end{align}
<p>
If we let our plaintext for the first 6 letters be the same for the
moment (say "AAAAAA"), then it becomes clear that we are finding the
hamming distance between the first three letters of the key, and the
second three letters of the key:
</p>
\begin{equation}
H(K[0:3],K[3:6])=5
\end{equation}
<p>
But, \(L=3\) was just a guess, we have to try different key
lengths. Something special happens when we guess \(L=6\) in our example
(remember K="SECRETSECRETSECRET&#x2026;"):
</p>
\begin{equation}
H(K[0:6],K[6:12])=0
\end{equation}
<p>
but we don't or have the key yet, all we have is the cipher text:
</p>
\begin{equation}
H(C[0:6],C[6:12])=15
\end{equation}
<p>
Notice however, that this is just the hamming distance between the
first 12 characters of our plaintext:
</p>
\begin{equation}
H(P[0:6],P[6:12])=15
\end{equation}

<p>
It should hopefully be clear that when we find the hamming distance
between parts of our cipher text using the correct key length, we are
only finding the hamming distance between parts of the plain text.  If
we guess the wrong key length, the cancellation doesn't occur and it
will result in a larger hamming distance.  This leads to the
procedure: guess multiple key lengths and choose the key length with
the smallest hamming distance.

<h2 id="sec-3">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
The last two challenges in the first set get us ready for what's
coming in the next set.  Challenge 7 forces us to figure out how to
use OpenSSL in our language of choice, and Challenge 8 introduces us
to an important feature of AES in ECB (Electronic Code Book) mode.  In
ECB, identical 16 bytes of plaintext will encode to the same 16 byte
cipher text.  
</p>

<p>
As the challenges state, if you can make it through Challenge 6, then
you're qualified to finish all 6 sets.  The later sets will require
more and more infrastructure to set up the attacks, but in general you
won't have more moving pieces than Challenge 6.
