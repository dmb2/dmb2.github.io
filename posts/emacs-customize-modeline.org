As disciples of Emacs we are constantly working to build an ecosystem
of elisp which supports our editing styles.  As we enable various
major and minor modes, Emacs tries to do its best to give us reminders
of which modes are enabled for the current buffer.  I firmly believe
that a UI should work hard provide as much relevant information as
possible without distracting from the user's focus.  The UI should
also be as intuitive as possible, allowing the user to self-discover
additional functionality as they learn the system.

Emacs is definitely not intuitive, but once a user is accustomed to
the environment, it really wins when it comes to self-discovery of
extra features.  Out of the box however, there is a significant amount
of visual noise.  Inspired by [[http://emacs-doctor.com/emacs-strip-tease.html][Emacs, naked]], I stripped down my
interface.  Two things that bothered me in following "Emacs, naked":
the wide fringe and no mode-line. On the other end of the spectrum is
[[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs][Spacemacs]] and [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/PowerLine][powerline]].  These provide as much information as
possible.  Of course there's also [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DiminishedModes][diminish]], which allows you to tell
emacs which minor modes to show and and not.  The trouble with
diminish is that it never played well with my =.emacs= when Emacs is
run as a daemon (I know there are workarounds, but they bothered me).

After some serious contemplation about which pieces of information in
the mode-line were most important to me, I set about trimming it down
to size. 
#+CAPTION: Comparison of default to customized UIs

| Default UI                | Customized UI                |

If you want my mode-line without any further understanding stick this
in your =.emacs=:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default mode-line-format
        (list
         " " mode-line-modified
         " %[" mode-line-buffer-identification "%] %l %6 "
         mode-line-misc-info
         mode-line-end-spaces))
  (setq global-mode-string '((t jabber-activity-mode-string)
                            "" display-time-string appt-mode-string)) 
#+END_SRC

Since the mode-line is so fundamental to emacs, we have to set the
format string slightly different than other variables.  This is
achieved through =setq-default=.  The documentation does a pretty good
job of describing what the various options are, but it was not clear
to me how to achieve the interactivity of the default mode-line. 

In my minimal setup, the =car= of the list is " ", which is a string.
This tells emacs to process the rest of the list and concatenate the
results into a string to be displayed in the mode-line.  The next
element of this list is =mode-line-modified=, which when eval'ed gives
the modification state of the mode-line, but also provides the ability
to use the mouse to toggle the states. The next string prints a "["
for each recursive editing level entered.  Next
=mode-line-buffer-identification= gives the buffer name, and the
ability to left and right click to cycle through the buffers. Then I
close the number of recursive edits with "%]".  The last bit of
information I find useful is the line number. If you prefer the
original line information, the function to add is
=mode-line-position=, this is too verbose for me, and I rarely need to
look at the column, so I've replaced this with the "%l" directive
which gives me the raw line number.  The next bit: "%6" gives 6
spaces before any other functions add to the mode line.

The next piece, =mode-line-misc-info=, includes the variable
=global-mode-string= which is a catch-all for transient
notifications.  The two that are relevant to me are:
=jabber-activity-mode-string= which displays who has sent me an unread
message on jabber, and =display-time-string= and =appt-mode-string=
which display information when I have upcoming appointments in my
agenda.
